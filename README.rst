*******

Disimpy is a tool for generating synthetic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
data that is useful in the development and validation of new data acquisition
and analysis methods.

The synthetic data is generated by massively parallelized Monte Carlo
simulations on Nvidia's CUDA-capable GPUs according to the simulation framework
established by Hall et al. [1]_.
