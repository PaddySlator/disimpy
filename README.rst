Disimpy is a tool for generating synthetic diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
data that is useful in the development and validation of new data acquisition
and analysis methods. The synthetic data is generated using massively
parallelized Monte Carlo simulations on Nvidia's CUDA-capable GPUs. Details
of the signal generation can be found in [1]_.
